The script gets the html content of the Vodafone PS5 site and searches for a "in stock" string.

If successful it logs into an email of a user and sends notification of availability.

If running on Linux add to Crontab to start the script at system startup.

It wouldn't be hard to modify the script to check other sites aswell.
